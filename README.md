This script is made by me and OpenAI to simplify analysis of DNA sequences.
It does next things:
1. Analyse your sequence in Expasy: SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics; 2. blastp each of received amino acid sequences; 3. Use the best alignment to show you amino acid changes in format suitable for SIFT - Predict effects of nonsynonmous / missense variants.
Hope it helps. Enjoy:)
